# EE69210: Machine Learning for Signal Processing Laboratory 
The repository consists of the experiments done in the Machine Learning for Signal Processing Laboratory performed during the Spring Semester 2024-25 at Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. All the codes are written from scratch without using any in-built functions for the task. The experiments conducted are in the following order:

- **Lossy Compression:** Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition
- **Lossless Compression:** Huffman coding, Lossless image compression and compressed file structure
- **Bayesian Classification:** Maximum Liklihood Estimation for Audio Classification
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests:** Building a decision tree, Bagging, and visualization of decision boundaries
