# EE69210: Machine Learning for Signal Processing Laboratory (Spring 2024-2025)
The repository consists of the experiments done in the Machine Learning for Signal Processing Laboratory performed during the Spring Semester 2024-25. All the codes are written from scratch without using any in-built functions for the task. The experiments conducted are in the following order:

- **Experiment-1:** Lossy Compression: Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition
- **Experiment-2:** Lossless Compression: Huffman coding, Lossless image compression and compressed file structure
